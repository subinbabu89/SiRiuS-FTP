#SiRiuS FTP - the other FTP client implementation

The aim of this project is to create a ftp implementation so that the client and server are multithreaded. The client will be able to handle multiple commands (from same user) simultaneously and server should be able to handle multiple commands from multiple client. The overall interaction between the user and the system is similar.
